        Welcome to my webpage. After years of thinking about making one I have finally gotten to that moment where I just start doing it.
        <br>
        This page is made purely of HTML and CSS... Until I couldn't get the hover of the links and list elements in the side bars to sync up.
        So I had to use some JavaScript.
        <br>
        Meaning this page is made purely of HTML, CSS and JavaScript... Until I decided to use shared HTML files across pages and had to use 
        JQuery's load function to load them in.
        <br>
        Meaning this page is made of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. I will 100% add more stuff as I make it bigger because I love shortcuts <em>:)</em>
        <br>
        I have also tried to make a mobile friendly version of the website. You can try it on your PC by resizing the window, or you can just try it on your phone ;)
    </p>

    <p">
        Enough talking about the website. Now it's time to talk about myself. I go by many names online, although mainly GO_AWAY_77, which is a very inviting username.
        I have also used M_Lighining (typo included), GO_AWATY (When GO_AWAY is taken :'( ), and Moddy, which I have not used in over 10 years.
        Outside of the names I have chosen for myself. People have chosen to call my GA, SullenDrat and most recently Spine Eater.
    </p>
    <p>
        I would describe myself as a man of many skills, yet a master of none. I like to try out new thing, but this leads to me jumping ship to try yet another new thing.
        Throughout my time on this rock I have tried:
        <ul>
            <li>Piano (forced)</li>
            <li>Hacking Sega Genesis games</li>
            <li>Simple 3D modelling with Blender</li>
            <li>Captaining countless amatuer Rocket League teams</li>
            <li>Helping as a moderator in amatuer Rocket League teams</li>
            <li>Building a Rocket League bot</li>
            <li>10+ different rhythm games and counting</li>
            <li>Embedded programming, web app programming, AI programming, simulation programming</li>
            <li>Football. Mainly as a goalkeeper</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        On top of all these things I enjoy watching and playing sports. I liked badminton, ping pong, ultimate frisbee, voleyball, water polo and others I cannot remember.
        I also like picking up a new math topic to learn about, reading 5-6 chapters, then getting either too busy, bored or confused to continue. 
        Some are related to my studies, but sometimes I just find an interesting book and go with the flow.
        I also have a habit of browsing what's on Edx and joining a bunch of the interesting Edx classes every now and then. I have managed to finish only one so far.
        It was on digital audio. For the others I just ran out of free access time before I could finish them.
    </p>
    <p>That was all the stuff I do in my free time. Outside of that I am a simple university student. 
        I have gotten a bachelors in computer engineering, and am now getting a masters in AI within vision and sound.
        My hope is to do research within AI understanding and theory.
        I am not fond of the fact that we see AI as a black box, and want to get a better theoretical understanding of the models.
        I also have thought about looking into low energy AI training, as I did not like that better AI models required huge number of GPUs, 
        but that was a while ago, and as I read more I realize that it is not as big as a problem as I thought it was.
        Other than that I am about to try out AI within sports video analysis. I find that very interesting because I like sports, but I won't know if it's for me before I try it out.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think that is enough rambling about myself. Right now the website is sparse, but I am planning to use it as my canvas and adding more stuff to it as I go.
        I might use it as some kind of a diary, or maybe to launch some projects. I have thought about making games or some web AI stuff, but that will have to wait for my next burst of motivation.
